# LLM App

Pathway's **LLM App** is a chatbot application which provides real-time responses to user queries, based on the freshest knowledge available in a document store. It does not require a separate vector database, and helps to avoid fragmented LLM stacks (such as ~Pinecone/Weaviate + Langchain + Redis + FastAPI +...~). Document data lives in the place where it was stored already, and on top of this, LLM App provides a light but integrated data processing layer, which is highly performant and can be easily customized and extended. It is particulary recommended for privacy-preserving LLM applications.

## Project Overview

LLM App reads a corpus of documents stored in S3 or locally, preprocesses them, and builds a vector index by calling a routine from the Pathway package. It then listens to user queries coming as HTTP REST requests. Each query uses the index to retrieve relevant documentation snippets and uses the OpenAI API/ Hugging Face to provide a response in natural language. The bot is reactive to changes in the corpus of documents: once new snippets are provided, it reindexes them and starts to use the new knowledge to answer subsequent queries.

(Available soon)


### Key Features
- **HTTP REST queries:** The system is capable of responding in real-time to HTTP REST queries.
- **Real-time document indexing pipeline:** This pipeline reads data directly from S3-compatible storage, without the need to query a vector document database.
- **User session and beta testing handling:** The query building process can be extended to handle user sessions and beta testing for new models.
- **Code reusability for offline evaluation:** The same code can be used for static evaluation of the system.

## Getting Started

This section provides a general introduction on how to start using the app.

### Installation

- **Clone the repository:** This is done with the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app.git
    ```

- **Virtual Python Environment:** Create a new environment and install the required packages to isolate the dependencies of this project from your system's Python:

    ```bash
    # Creates an env called pw-env and activates this environment.
    python -m venv pw-env && source pw-env/bin/activate
    # Navigate to the repository and install the packages in requirements.txt
    cd llm_app/
    pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://packages.pathway.com/966431ef6ba -r requirements.txt
    ```
### Usage

1. **Environment Variables:** Create an .env file in `llm_app/` directory and add the following environment variables, adjusting their values according to your specific requirements and setup.
    ```bash
    PATHWAY_REST_CONNECTOR_HOST=127.0.0.1
    PATHWAY_REST_CONNECTOR_PORT=8080
    OPENAI_API_TOKEN=<Your Token>
    PATHWAY_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/cache
    ```
    If you are not running the local version, please remember to replace `OPENAI_API_TOKEN` with your personal API token, which you can generate from your account on [openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

2. **Run the App:** You can start the application with the command:
    ```bash 
    cd llm_app/
    python main.py --mode contextful
    ```
    The `--mode contextful` option means that the software will index the documents in `data/pathway-docs` and take them into account when processing queries. The pathway pipeline being run is in `llm_app/pathway_pipelines/contextful/app.py`

    You can also run the app without the need for external APIs by using `local` mode.

3. **Send REST queries** (in a separate terminal window): These are examples of how to interact with the application once it's running. `curl` is a command-line tool used to send data using various network protocols. Here, it's being used to send HTTP requests to the application.
    ```bash
    curl --data '{"user": "user", "query": "How to connect to Kafka in Pathway?"}' http://localhost:8080/ | jq

    curl --data '{"user": "user", "query": "How to use LLMs in Pathway?"}' http://localhost:8080/ | jq
    ```

4. **Test reactivity by adding a new file:** This shows how to test the application's ability to react to changes in data by adding a new file and sending a query.
    ```bash
    cp ./data/documents_extra.jsonl ./data/pathway-docs/
    curl --data '{"user": "user", "query": "How to use LLMs in Pathway?"}' http://localhost:8080/ | jq
    ```

### Data Privacy and Use in Organizations

LLM App can be configured to run with local Machine Learning models, without making API calls outside of the User's Organization.

It can also be extended to handle live data sources (news feeds, API's, data streams in Kafka), to include user permissions, a data security layer, and an LLMops monitoring layer.

See: [Features for Organizations](FEATURES-for-organizations.md).

This repository contains the code for our Pathway-based LLM App, which is designed to provide real-time responses to queries about the Pathway documentation.

## Project Overview

The app reads a corpus of documents stored in S3 or locally, preprocesses them, and builds a Pathway vector index. It then listens to user queries coming as HTTP REST requests. Each query uses the index to retrieve relevant documentation snippets and uses the OpenAI API/ Hugging Face to provide a response in natural language. The bot is reactive to changes in the corpus of documents: once new snippets are provided, it reindexes them and starts to use the new knowledge to answer subsequent queries.

(Available soon)


### Key Features
- **HTTP REST queries:** The system is capable of responding in real-time to HTTP REST queries.
- **Real-time document indexing pipeline:** This pipeline reads data directly from S3-compatible storage, without the need to query a vector document database.
- **User session and beta testing handling:** The query building process can be extended to handle user sessions and beta testing for new models.
- **Code reusability for offline evaluation:** The same code can be used for static evaluation of the system.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository. Create a new environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv pw-env && source pw-env/bin/activate
cd llm-app-pathway/
pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://packages.pathway.com/966431ef6ba -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage

- Create an .env file in `llm_app/` directory and add the following environment variables:
```bash
PATHWAY_REST_CONNECTOR_HOST=127.0.0.1
PATHWAY_REST_CONNECTOR_PORT=8080
OPENAI_API_TOKEN=<Your Token>
PATHWAY_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/cache
```

- Run the script using the command: 
```bash 
cd llm_app/
python main.py --mode contextful
```
You can also run the app without the need for external APIs by using `local` mode.

- Send REST queries (in a separate terminal window):
```bash
curl --data '{"user": "user", "query": "How to connect to Kafka in Pathway?"}' http://localhost:8080/ | jq

curl --data '{"user": "user", "query": "How to use LLMs in Pathway?"}' http://localhost:8080/ | jq
```

- Test reactivity by adding a new file:
```bash
cp ./data/documents_extra.jsonl ./data/pathway-docs/
curl --data '{"user": "user", "query": "How to use LLMs in Pathway?"}' http://localhost:8080/ | jq
```
